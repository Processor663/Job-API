# Job-API

This project demonstrates best practices in backend engineering, including layered architecture, token-based authentication, role-based authorization, centralized error handling, and security hardening techniques suitable for real-world deployment. The API is designed to be modular, maintainable, and extensible, making it suitable for integration into enterprise-level recruitment systems, HR platforms, or freelance marketplaces.
